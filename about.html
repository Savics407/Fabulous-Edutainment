                        and never refined their gifts. Most often, their decision to choose a certain area of study is motivated more by
                        economic potentials than personal fulfillment. So, they either graduate then get stock looking for a job or finds a
                        job that gives them the money but still grapple with the complexity of understanding the purpose for their lives.

                <p class="heading-p"> These youths go through life not knowing who they are and where they are going. They tend to flow
                    along with or without finances feeling unfulfilled and unsatisfied. They miss opportunities because of ignorance of
                    what to do in alignment to their purpose.</p>
